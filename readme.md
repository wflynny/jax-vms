# JAX VMs

A few scripts I pipe directly into bash to get setup on various VMs.
(This is a stop-gap while we get some formal orchestration setup)

## Usage

Start a VM, locate one of the scripts that fits your usecase, and then
```{bash}
curl <raw_url> | sudo bash
```

## Examples:

- [singularity builder]()
- [miniconda installation]()
- [service account setup]()
